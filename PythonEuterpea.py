# Euterpea is a library for music representation and creation in the Haskell
# programming language. This file represents a port of the "core" features
# of Euterpea's score-level or note-level features. This includes classes that
# mirror the various constructors of the Music data type as well as functions
# for conversion to MIDI.
#
# Haskell Euterpea's "Music a" polymorphism is captured in the Note class by
# way of optional parameters like vol (volume) and params (any type). There is
# also an optional params field that is not used by the MIDI export backend.
